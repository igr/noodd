      I'll protect you from the hooded claw<br>
      Keep the vampires from your door<br>
      <br>
      I, feels like fire<br>
      I'm so in love with you<br>
      Dreams are like angels<br>
      They keep bad at bay, bad at bay<br>
      Love is the light<br>
      Scaring darkness away, yeah<br>
