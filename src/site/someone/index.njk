      I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited<br>
      But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it<br>
      I had hoped you'd see my face<br>
      And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over<br>
      <br>
      Never mind, I'll find someone like you<br>
      I wish nothing but the best for you, too<br>
      "Don't forget me, " I beg<br>
      I remember you said<br>
      "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"<br>
